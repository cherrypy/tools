== JSON-RPC ==

Requires [http://jsolait.net jsolait]; extract it to javascript directory, or change path in cfg file and demo file.

If an error occurs on the server it will be reported back to jsolait.

JSON functions have to be exposed as such, which mean less confusion.

The demo was tested with Windows XP, IE 6 and FF 1.0+. Theoretically, it should work with any browser that supports xmlhttp function (a la AJAX). If you have tested this on another platform or browser, please let us know.

Note that most browsers will not request data from a server other than the one containing the xmlhttp call (this minimizes cross-site scripting attacks).

== Getting it working ==

Run cherrypy 2.0 and not 2.1 since that breaks things.  Also you might get permission problems using firefox, so use IE.

You need to copy the following files to C:\Python23\Lib\site-packages\cherrypy\lib\filter

{{{
json.py
jsonrpcfilter.py
xyaptu.py
xyaptufilter.py
yaptu.py
}}}

You get the xyaptufilter stuff from [http://www.cherrypy.org/wiki/XyaptuFilter]

There are two programs you want to get running.  The first is the one is jsontest.py which is driven by .....\javascript\tester.html.  The second is the quadratic app which I have no tips to share since I haven't got that far yet.
