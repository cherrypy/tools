I've just started to build a CP module for [http://www.fckeditor.net FCKeditor].

It is in his first stages. Comments and tests results are welcome.

To use it, you must:
  * download and install fckeditor.py
  * download and install FCKeditor in a folder called "FCKeditor"
  * create 2 folders: "content" and "images". They will be used to store pages and images.
  * create a CP config file referencing "content" and "images" as static elements.
{{{
[staticContent]
content=content
images=images
}}}

  * Finally, you must tell to FCKeditor that CP is his friends. For that adapt FCKeditor/fckconfig.js like following:
{{{
   FCKConfig.ImageBrowser = true ;
+  FCKConfig.ImageBrowserURL = FCKConfig.BasePath + "filemanager/browser/default/browser.html?Type=Image&Connector=/editor/connector" ;
-  FCKConfig.ImageBrowserURL = FCKConfig.BasePath + 'filemanager/browser/default/browser.html?Type=Image&Connector=connectors/asp/connector.asp' ;
}}}

Be careful to align your cpg.root to Connector URL and to remove (or comment) the existing asp Filemanager. 

Voila!!
Start your CP daemon: python fckeditor.py and browse to localhost:8080/ and follow simple links I've put there.

I've tested it with FCKeditor-2.0RC2 and FCKeditor-2.0RC3 on Gentoo with FireFox-1.0. Following FCKeditor website it works with IE 5.5+, Firefox 1.0+, Mozilla 1.3+ and Netscape 7+.

  There is a bug with edit link. The way in which the test.html is written into the page for editing causes Javascript errors. Below is the diff of a fix.
