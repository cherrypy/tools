== Sample Guestbook ==

'''Hi there!''' This is a sample/simple guestbook I wrote to learn CherryPy's ropes. The guestbook has a silly name which shouldn't affect it's functionality ;-) Actually I used it like a sentinel to see if I was outputting UTF-8 encoded data (looks like it's working).

Even though it's simple it requires:
 * Python 2.4 (for the @cpg.expose decorator)
 * CherryPy
 * [http://cherrytemplate.python-hosting.com/ CherryTemplate]
 * [http://www.postgresql.org/ PostgreSQL] (I'm using 8.01 but that shouldn't matter)... btw I'm a happy user of [http://www.sqlmanager.net/products/postgresql/manager/download EMS PostgreSQL Manager Lite]
 * psycopg which you can find [http://www.stickpeople.com/projects/python/psycopg/ precompiled for Windows] or [http://initd.org/svn/initd/ in source here]

=== PostgreSQL schema (because I hate examples that use XML!) ===
{{{
#!sql
CREATE TABLE "public"."tblentry" (
  "entryid" SERIAL, 
  "entrytext" VARCHAR(1000) NOT NULL, 
  "entryauthor" VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, 
  "entryemail" VARCHAR(255), 
  "entrydate" TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE DEFAULT now(), 
  "entryparentid" NUMERIC DEFAULT 0, 
  CONSTRAINT "tblentry_pkey" PRIMARY KEY("entryid")
) WITH OIDS;
}}}

Then download the zip below. The CSS is inside the icons directory because I was too lazy to create a separate directory for it and I was too lazy to test it with IE but it actually looks nice in Firefox... and you ARE using Firefox, right?!?

The admin area of the guestbook is reachable at http://localhost:8080/Admin
 * username: admin
 * password: glenda


That's all folks! Take care.

P.S Please note that if you download the tar.gz there is a mis-routing comment in the .py file which has been removed in the .zip version. You actually need to run it with a config file. Simple as that!
